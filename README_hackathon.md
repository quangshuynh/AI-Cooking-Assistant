## Prize Catergories to be Considered For
- ### No Ducks Left Behind
  Chef's F.A.R.T.S. is an accessible tool for all ages and skill levels. Chef's ability to create recipes for those with dietary restrictions,
  low-income families, and culinary novices illustrates its effectiveness as being an accessible application.
- ### First Flight
  Chef's F.A.R.T.S. was created by first-time hackathon participants.
- ### United We Quack
  Cuisine is an important part of the identity of a culture. Cuisine is part of how many first interact with other people's cultures
  and learn from them. Chef's values this aspect of the culinary experience and emphasizes the importance of having underrepresented
  cultures and their ethnic cuisines in its recipe creation. Very few tools allow you the ability to create homemade, authentic
  Peruvian or Nigerian meals in your home using ingredients you have in your cabinet or available at your local grocery store.
  Chef's prides itself on its cuisine diversity, ability to teach about ethnic meals, and provide representation to the
  ALANA (African, Latin, Asian, and Native American) communities culture and food.
